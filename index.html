                        <h3>Modifying Images</h3>
                        <p>It is important to use descriptive filenames because once the application becomes very large, filenames can get very confusing.</p>

                        <p>I used the MacOs Preview App to resize the original image.</p>
                        
                        <p>The original image size was 2121 Ã— 1414 pixels.</p>
                        
                        <h4>Image Before Compression</h4>
                        <img alt="hand writing HTML 5 on glass" src="images/html5.jpeg" width="500" height="333">
                        
                        <!-- 4th paragraph element: Use the paragraph element below to identify the online image compressor you used to reduce the file size. What was the original image file size? What was the reduced image file size? Use complete sentences.  -->
                        <p>I used compressor.io to compress the html5 image. This reduced the original filesize that was 61 KB, to a size of 7 KB.</p>
                        
                        <h4>Image After Compression</h4>
                        <!-- Use image element below to insert the image after compression, html5_min.jpg -->
                        <img alt="hand writing HTML 5 on glass" src="images/html5_min.jpeg" width="500" height="333">
                        
                        <!-- 5th paragraph element: Use the paragraph element below to note any visual changes that you can see between html5.jpg and html5_min.jpg -->
                        <p>I cannot see any noticeable differences between these images.</p>

                            <svg width="100" height="100">

                            <p>I used W3 Schools resource to build an SVG. SVGs are super simple to create.</p>
